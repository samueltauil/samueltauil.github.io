Sometimes the best ideas come from real-world challenges. While working on GitHub Copilot demos, I kept running into the same situation: defining agents and customizing their interfaces felt like a chore. It wasn't about capability—Copilot is a really powerful tool—but the process of shaping agent definitions and handoff workflows was a bit manual. I thought, what if this could feel creative instead of repetitive?

That question led to **Copilot Agent Designer**, a Visual Studio Code extension built to make agent design visual, interactive, and fun.

## What is Copilot Agent Designer?

Instead of editing raw Markdown files or tweaking line by line, you can now design agents like you would in a creative studio. The extension gives you:

- **Instant previews** — See your agent come to life as you design
- **Theme playground** — Experiment with different visual styles
- **Full control** — Customize fonts, colors, avatars, and more
- **One-click export** — Generate production-ready `agent.md` or `chatmode.md` files

When you're ready, export and integrate seamlessly with Copilot to start using custom agents in your IDE.

## Why I Built This

This wasn't about fixing a gap—it was about **unlocking creativity and speed** for developers who want to build polished experiences without friction. Designing agents should feel like creating, not configuring.

## Get Started
